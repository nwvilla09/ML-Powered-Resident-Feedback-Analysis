# Machine Learning (ML)-Powered Resident Feedback Analysis

This repository demonstrates key qualifications for a strategic role in municipal management, focusing on data-driven decision-making and process improvement.

## Summary:

* A prototype system that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze a large dataset of over 500 resident comments. The script automatically classifies feedback, performs time-series analysis, and generates a professional **PDF executive summary** with actionable recommendations. This showcases an ability to translate raw data into strategic insights for leadership.



## 1. Objective

This project demonstrates a robust system for analyzing resident feedback at scale. Using a dataset of over 500 comments spanning two fiscal quarters, it automatically processes unstructured text to identify trends, gauge sentiment, and produce a high-level executive summary to inform strategic decisions.

## 2. Key Capabilities Demonstrated

- **Large-Scale Data Analysis**: Efficiently processes a significant volume of data.
- **ML & Automation**: Leverages NLP to automate classification and sentiment analysis.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Tracks metrics over time to identify seasonal trends and emerging issues.
- **Strategic Reporting**: Translates complex data into a clear, concise **PDF Executive Summary** with actionable recommendations for leadership.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Provides a data-driven foundation for identifying and addressing service delivery gaps.

## 3. The Executive Summary

The primary output is a multi-page PDF report (`Executive_Summary.pdf`) which includes:

- An **overview** of the data and key performance indicators.
- **Visualizations**, including comment volume by department, sentiment breakdowns, and a time-series chart of feedback volume.
- A **Key Findings** section highlighting the most critical insights from the analysis.
- A **Recommendations** section offering specific, data-backed suggestions for operational improvements.

## 4. How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. From this directory, install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the analysis script: `python analysis_pipeline.py`
4. Open the newly generated `Executive_Summary.pdf` in the `reports` folder.
