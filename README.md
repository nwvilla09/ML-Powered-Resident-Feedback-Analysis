# Machine Learning (ML)-Powered Resident Feedback Analysis

### **Business Summary**

- **Problem:** Government agencies and healthcare systems receive a high volume of unstructured feedback from the public through emails, surveys, and social media. Manually sorting and understanding this feedback is slow, costly, and inconsistent, causing organizations to miss critical trends and opportunities to improve service.
  
- **Process:** This project utilizes **Machine Learning (ML)** and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in **Python**. A trained model is used to automatically process text-based feedback. The model performs two key tasks: sentiment analysis (classifying feedback as positive, negative, or neutral) and topic modeling (categorizing comments into themes like "billing," "staff conduct," or "facility cleanliness").
  
- **Solution:** The result is an automated pipeline that processes resident feedback in real time. It generates a summary dashboard that displays trends in public sentiment and highlights the most frequently discussed topics, eliminating the need for manual review.
  
- **Impact:** This tool empowers public sector leaders to be more responsive to community needs. It allows for the rapid identification of widespread issues, recognition of high-performing departments, and efficient allocation of resources to areas needing improvement. This leads to better public relations, enhanced operational efficiency, and a higher quality of service delivery.This repository demonstrates key qualifications for a strategic role in municipal management, focusing on data-driven decision-making and process improvement.


## 1. Objective

This project demonstrates a robust system for analyzing resident feedback at scale. Using a dataset of over 500 comments spanning two fiscal quarters, it automatically processes unstructured text to identify trends, gauge sentiment, and produce a high-level executive summary to inform strategic decisions.

## 2. Key Capabilities Demonstrated

- **Large-Scale Data Analysis**: Efficiently processes a significant volume of data.
- **ML & Automation**: Leverages NLP to automate classification and sentiment analysis.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Tracks metrics over time to identify seasonal trends and emerging issues.
- **Strategic Reporting**: Translates complex data into a clear, concise **PDF Executive Summary** with actionable recommendations for leadership.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Provides a data-driven foundation for identifying and addressing service delivery gaps.

## 3. The Executive Summary

The primary output is a multi-page PDF report (`Executive_Summary.pdf`) which includes:

- An **overview** of the data and key performance indicators.
- **Visualizations**, including comment volume by department, sentiment breakdowns, and a time-series chart of feedback volume.
- A **Key Findings** section highlighting the most critical insights from the analysis.
- A **Recommendations** section offering specific, data-backed suggestions for operational improvements.

## 4. How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. From this directory, install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the analysis script: `python analysis_pipeline.py`
4. Open the newly generated `Executive_Summary.pdf` in the `reports` folder.
